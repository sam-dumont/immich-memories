# Upgrading

Read the [release notes](https://github.com/sam-dumont/immich-memories/releases),
back up the store, then upgrade. Keep the backup for rollback: a newer release can migrate the
store to a revision older code will refuse.

## Server addresses

With authentication enabled, setting `auth.public_url` restricts requests to its hostname,
localhost and entries in `server.allowed_hosts`. If you also open the app by a LAN IP or
another hostname, add those addresses to `advanced.server.allowed_hosts` before upgrading.
Otherwise those requests receive HTTP 421.

An `immich.url` containing a username or password fails startup. Remove the credentials
from the URL and use `immich.api_key`. This also applies to each account's URL under
`immich.accounts`. If a reverse proxy requires URL credentials, give the app a private route
to Immich that accepts its API key.

## HTTP monitoring and request limits

With authentication enabled, `/health` and `/health/ready` keep their status codes and JSON
fields, but return `null` for operational details without a valid session. This includes
`configuration`, `immich` and `immich_reachable`. Use the HTTP status for readiness probes;
sign in to read the detailed diagnosis.

Writes under `/api/` and `/auth/`, plus `/logout`, accept bodies up to 4 MiB. Larger requests
return HTTP 413. The soundtrack upload route keeps its separate 64 MiB file limit.

## API key permissions

Existing keys with **All** permissions continue to work. Preflight now warns about their broad
access; replace them with the [documented read set](../docker.md#the-api-key), adding upload
rights only when needed. Run `immich-memories config test` after changing a key.

Missing read permissions stop a cut before it starts. Missing upload or tagging permissions
keep the completed film locally with a download option and a specific delivery message.
Without `asset.delete`, previous versions remain in Immich. Partner keys need only read rights.

## Docker

Back up while the old release is still running:

```bash
docker compose exec immich-memories immich-memories store backup
docker compose cp immich-memories:/home/immich/.immich-memories/backups ./backups
```

Keep that backup and manifest. Download the new release's Compose assets and set
`IMMICH_MEMORIES_VERSION=X.Y.Z` in `.env`, without the `v` prefix. That one value selects matching
app, inference and standalone worker images; the CUDA file adds the inference CUDA suffix.
Keep your chosen `COMPOSE_FILE`, credentials and saved Settings. If you use a single-file export,
regenerate it with the new version and preserve its private settings key. Then upgrade:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec immich-memories immich-memories models fetch
docker compose exec immich-memories immich-memories preflight
```

Config and films survive a recreate.
`models fetch` checks the new release's pins and downloads only changed files.

## uv / pip

```bash
immich-memories store backup
uv tool upgrade immich-memories
immich-memories models fetch
immich-memories preflight
```

For pip, keep the same extras:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "immich-memories[all]"
```

On Apple Silicon, use `immich-memories[all-mac]`, or `immich-memories[all-mac,auth]` for OIDC.

## Kubernetes and Terraform

Back up, change the pinned image tag, apply, then run `models fetch` and `preflight` in the app
container. The base init container skips fetching when its required paths are present, so changed
pins need the explicit fetch. The generated GPU setup runs `models fetch --detectors --laya`
whenever its model init container runs, verifying existing artifact digests.
See [Kubernetes upgrades](../kubernetes.md#upgrading-and-rollback) or
[Terraform upgrades](../terraform.md#upgrading).

## Upgrading Immich from v2 to v3

Leave version detection on auto:

```yaml
immich:
  api_version: auto
```

After upgrading Immich:

```bash
immich-memories config test
```

This read-only check prints the resolved v2/v3 contract. Overrides are for troubleshooting a
proxy, not an upgrade step. Originals are unchanged.

### Immich 3.3

- **Country names.** Immich 3.3 stores GeoNames' English country names ("The Netherlands",
  "Turkey", "Cabo Verde"). The app reads those and the earlier names alike, so titles and captions
  still translate the country.
- **Stacks.** Add `stack.read` to the key if you want a stack (an edit and its original, a burst)
  to play as its top picture. It is optional: without it the run logs one warning per account and
  treats every stacked picture as its own candidate.
- **Native people sharing** accepts 3.3.0-rc.1, later 3.3.0 release candidates and every 3.3
  release. See [A second Immich account](../multi-account.mdx).

## Config compatibility

Unknown fields inside a known section are ignored; invalid values or unknown top-level sections
fail startup. A renamed setting can stop taking effect, so check the release notes. A removed key
is dropped with a warning at startup that names it and says what to do, for example:

```text
Ignoring config keys that no longer exist in config.yaml; delete them to silence this:
  audio.music_volume_db: nothing read it; remove it from your config
  defaults.output_orientation: the CLI picks the orientation; remove it from your config
```

Delete the key once you've read why.

The low-end tier is `basic`. A `tier: nas` in YAML, `IMMICH_MEMORIES_TIER=nas`,
`IMMICH_MEMORIES_DEPLOYMENT_TIER=nas` or a saved Settings value of `nas` stops startup with
`tier 'nas' is now called 'basic': set tier: basic`. Change the value to `basic`.

The reader only runs with `advanced.llm.enabled: true`. A config that sets `advanced.llm.base_url`,
`model` or another reader field without it keeps the reader off: model titles, music mood and model
selection stay off, startup logs a warning naming the fields it found (never their values), and
`preflight` reports **Reader configured but disabled**. Add `enabled: true` under `advanced.llm`.
See [enabling a reader](../config-file.md#enabling-a-reader).

The store upgrades its schema when opened. Keep a backup and its manifest from before an update;
if you roll back the app, restore the matching backup rather than downgrading a live schema.
Keep the app, inference image and render worker on matching version tags.

## Rollback

Restore the backup taken before upgrading if the newer release migrated the store.
Stop the app before restoring. [Container restore](./storage-backups.md#restore)
uses a one-off process, not `exec` in the running app.

For Docker, use this order. The backup and its manifest must be together on the mounted config
volume. Replace the example backup name with yours (`.dump` for PostgreSQL):

```bash
docker compose stop immich-memories
# Set image: to the old release in Compose (and its override, if present).
# Align inference and render worker tags with that release too.
docker compose pull
docker compose run --rm immich-memories immich-memories store restore \
  --from /home/immich/.immich-memories/backups/store-20260930T090000Z.db --force
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec immich-memories immich-memories preflight
```

Python:

```bash
uv tool install --force --python 3.12 "immich-memories[all]==X.Y.Z"
```

Kubernetes/Terraform: restore the old image tag and apply, then restore the old store backup with
that release. Schema downgrades can drop tables and rows; the backup is the rollback.

## Inspecting the store before an upgrade

`store status`, `store backup`, `config show` and `preflight` read the existing schema without
upgrading it, including saved settings. A revision mismatch reports the actual and expected
schema. Back up first; `ui`, `generate`, `auto` and the explicit `store migrate` command upgrade
the configured store before writing.
